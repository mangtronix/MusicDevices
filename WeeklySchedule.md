# Week 3

## Week 3.1
Arduino for NIME
- [Arduino in 100 Seconds (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ENiVwk8idM)

- Distribute class kits

Hardware kit
- [Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather (Adafruit)](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-reverse-tft-feather/overview)
    - Uses Adafruit [Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/overview) form factor
    - FeatherWings are similar to Arduino Shields - stackable add-on boards
    - QT connector allows connection to QT breakout boards
- STEMMA / QT / I2C breakout boards
    - I2C is a digital communication protocol for connecting different integrated circuits (ICs)
    - Uses 4 wires (Power, Ground, Data, Clock)
    - STEMMA / QT is a standard connector for the I2C bus
        - Convenient connection without soldering
    - [Working with I2C Devices (Adafruit)](https://learn.adafruit.com/working-with-i2c-devices/overview)
    - Reading/writing over I2C is slower than connecting directly to hardware like buttons and knobs
        - Can cause issues with e.g. missing incoming MIDI messages
- [Adafruit NeoKey 1x4 QT I2C Breakout (Adafruit)](https://learn.adafruit.com/neokey-1x4-qt-i2c)
- [Adafruit NeoSlider (Adafruit)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neoslider)

MIDI - Musical Instrument Digital Interface
- Standard for communication between digital instruments dating back to the 80s
- Allows e.g. a controller keyboard to be hooked up to a synthesizer module, or computer to record notes from a controller and play them back on a software or hardware synthesizer
- [Introduction to the MIDI Standard (Indiana University)](https://cecm.indiana.edu/361/midi.html)
- [MIDI (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) - comprehensive overview
- MIDI 1.0 is a very basic protocol
    - Uses 7-bit values (0-127)
    - Common messages
        - Note on/off
            - Based on 12-tone piano keyboard (e.g. C, C#, D, D#, E, F)
        - Continous controllers (CC) - e.g. knob value from 0-127
            - Can suffer from "stair stepping" audible artifacts
        - Pitch bend - 14-bit value from 0-16383
            - Pitch bend of 8192 means "no bend" / wheel centered
        - Modulation wheel - 14-bit value from 0-16383
            - Used to add expression depending on specific synthesizer / patch, e.g. player moves the mod wheel to smoothly change the sound
        - Clock, start, stop
        - System Exclusive - non-standard messages, e.g. upload / download synthesizer patch from software editor
    - Transmission speed / bandwidth is low (31250 bits per second, like an old modem)
        - Have to limit the rate of control change messages
        - [MIDI Advantages / Disadvantages (CCRMA)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~gary/controllers/midi.html)
    - Designed as unidirectional protocol, sender to receiver
        - e.g. keyboard -> sound module, MIDI keyboard -> computer -> synthesizer
        - controller and receiver have to be in agreement on control mapping
    - Not designed to represent fretless instruments or non-Western scales
        - [Oud Taksim Bayātī (بياتي, Uşşâk, Bayat) by Hesham Hamra (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DrzYlc8DAM)
            - This performance would be very difficult to represent using MIDI as it uses notes outside the 12-tone Western scale and incorporates string articulations as an important aspect of the performance
        - Playing quarter tone and "microtonal" scales can be accomplished using specialized software or hardware
            - [47SOUL - Intro To Shamstep (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N0phc4nK-0)
                - The keyboardist makes use of a special device ([Kelfar AK tuning converter](https://kelfar.net/ak-5-pro-world-scale-tuning-converter/)) designed specifically to enable Arabic scales for live performance
        - Demo of playing Maqam Bayati inside Ableton Live, using Western scale, Ableton tuning, and dedicated software instrument ([Taqsim SOLO](https://taqs.im/shop/solo/))
        - What kind of music did you grow up with? What instruments do your favourite musicians play? How well do you feel these instruments are represented in electronic music?
        - How do you think the instruments we have available affect the music we make and listen to?
- [MIDI for Makers (Adafruit)](https://learn.adafruit.com/midi-for-makers)
- MIDI 2.0
    - Just released in 2020, starting to be used
    - Allows bidirectional communication, "conversation" between devices
        - e.g. controller can ask "are you a mixer?" and configure itself accordingly or ask the name of a parameter that is being controlled in order to show it on a display as it's being manipulated
    - Higher resolution (e.g. 32-bit control values with 4 million steps)
    - More controllers
    - Better timing (e.g. play notes of chord together)
    - [What Musicians & Artists need to know about MIDI 2.0 (MIDI Association)](https://midi.org/what-musicians-artists-need-to-know-about-midi-2-0)
        - "Can MIDI 2.0 make it easier to have microtonal control and different non-western scales? Yes, MIDI 2.0 Voice Channel Messages allow Per Note precise control of the pitch of every note to better support non-western scales, arbitrary pitches, note retuning, dynamic pitch fluctuations or inflections, or to escape equal temperament when using the western 12 tone scale."
    - A bit early for us to use MIDI 2.0 but something to keep an eye on

### Homework

Due before start of next class

- **Watch** [Moldover's Approach to Controllerism (1 of 2) (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2McDeSKiOU)
- **Watch** [Moldover's Approach to Controllerism (2 of 2)
 (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/dznjQIarboY?si=oWTpcaw2dQ_p_V9q)
- **Read** [Moldover-The Godfather of Controllerism
(MIDI Association)](https://midi.org/moldover-the-godfather-of-controllerism)
    - What makes Moldover's approach to controller design effective or not effective?
    - How can combining controller design and sound design help you connect with an audience? What techniques are you planning to use?
- **Post** your response in the discussion forum
    - See Brightspace->Discussions->Readings for details
- **Be ready** to discuss the topic in class

## Week 5.2
Workshop: Musical sensors
- Connect buttons to trigger notes
- Connect potentiometers / faders to send CCs
- Connect a different sensor, e.g. LDR light sensor
    - Trigger note or CC

### Homework - Week 5.2

Due before start of next class

- **Perform** using your MIDI controller
    - Add more controls to your MIDI controller that allow you to perform a short piece of music in the style of Controllerism
    - Use at least one non-traditional UI element (something other than key, pot, fader)
        - e.g. light sensor, bend sensor, non-traditional switch
    - Create an Ableton Live set that goes with your MIDI controller
        - Some suggestions for possible integrations:
            - Trigger notes directly in instruments
            - Start / stop clips
            - Map to synthesizer parameters
            - Map to device parameters, for example arpeggiator settings
    - Record a short video of a performance using your controller and Ableton Live set
- **Post** your work in the discussion forum
    - See Brightspace->Discussions->Exercises for details
    - Host your video on a site like YouTube or Vimeo and embed it in your post
- **Be ready** to show / discuss your work in class
